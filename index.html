  <p class= "border">Cooking is a big deal in my family. My mom has been cooking for us  and making delicious meals my entire life. I am the youngest of five kids, so when she cooks, she cooks for a whole crowd of people and has enough for leftovers. She recently watched a documentary on Netflix, <em> What the Health?</em>, it's a documentary all about going vegan and how poorly animals are treated in the meat processing industry. Therefore, we're now eating and cooking only Vegan food at home. It's a big change for us, because as a Jewish family, meat, dairy and eggs are very important.</p>

  <p class= "border">She's had to make big changes in the way that she cooks and how she can incoporate a few Vegan dishes into holiday meals that everyone can enjoy. Because this Winter has been so incredibly cold, that menas soup and lots of it. So, she does a lot of Google-ing and then a lot of adapting of recipes to her own standards and what she has learned over many years of cooking. This soup is the result of that, and it was <strong> delicious!</strong></p>
